# Production Problem 5: Implementing HCI guidelines for touchscreens

## The Problem

Using the HCI guidelines from either Apple/iOS, Android, or Windows, redesign the login page at
http://my.iit.edu/ for a touch-friendly environment.

You only need to sketch your redesign, and in the text below, reference at least three different
points of guidance from chosen HCI guidelines that went into your redesign sketches (you might
want to do multiple sketches, each highlighting a different feature of the same overall design).

## Resources

* Apple iOS HCI Guidlines:
  https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/MobileHIG/
* Android Design Guidelines:
  http://developer.android.com/design/index.html
* Windows Desktop Guidelines:
  https://dev.windows.com/en-us/desktop/design

## Deliverables

Fine-grained, atomic commits to your Production Problems repository that include:

1) photographs of sketches of your new design, from your sketchbook
2) an explanation of three different points of guidance from your chosen guidelines (point to the
   specific URL where the guidance can be found) that you implemented in your sketch, written below:

* HCI Guideline One (URL): https://www.google.com/design/spec/animation/responsive-interaction.html#responsive-interaction-material-response
* How you implemented it in your sketch:
 User Response to Input: for this guideline I implemented a ripple effect to provide
 visual confirmation of touch.


* HCI Guideline Two (URL): https://www.google.com/design/spec/patterns/navigation.html
* How you implemented it in your sketch:
I used a small box in the upper right corner to represent a way to the navigation bar. When pressed the navigation sidebar will open"

* HCI Guideline Three (URL):
* How you implemented it in your sketch:
