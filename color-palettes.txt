# Production Problem 4: Color Palettes for HCI

## The Problem

Using either Adobe Color CC (https://color.adobe.com/), Paletton (http://paletton.com/), or another
Web-based palette generator of your choosing, you will create a number of different color palettes,
based on the requirements in the Deliverables section below.

## Deliverables

Fine-grained, atomic commits to your Production Problems repository that include:

1) screenshots of your web-based palette for the four palettes below;
2) an explanation, after each palette request below, why you chose the colors you did

* A monochromatic palette for a website that creates high-end, custom-made gaming laptops.

Explanation of your color choices:
  For this color palette I chose a to use dark colors, like black and dark/deep blue, with silver as an accent color.
  Black was described as powerful, masculine, and mysterious in our readings, dark blue was unemotional and reliable.
  Many video game sites make use of black as backdrop colors, or even as their main colors. Silver is associated with
  technology. Noting that it is a high-end gaming laptop company I felt these coloe combinations, communicated technology and
  sophistication.

* A shaded color palette for a website that sells natural and organic foods.
