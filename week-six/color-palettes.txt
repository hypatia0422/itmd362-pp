# Production Problem 4: Color Palettes for HCI

## The Problem

Using either Adobe Color CC (https://color.adobe.com/), Paletton (http://paletton.com/), or another
Web-based palette generator of your choosing, you will create a number of different color palettes,
based on the requirements in the Deliverables section below.

## Deliverables

Fine-grained, atomic commits to your Production Problems repository that include:

1) screenshots of your web-based palette for the four palettes below;
2) an explanation, after each palette request below, why you chose the colors you did

* A monochromatic palette for a website that creates high-end, custom-made gaming laptops.

Filename: mono.png
Explanation of your color choices:
  For this color palette I chose a to use dark colors, like black and dark/deep blue, with silver as an accent color.
  Black was described as powerful, masculine, and mysterious in our readings, dark blue was unemotional and reliable.
  Many video game sites make use of black as backdrop colors, or even as their main colors. Silver is associated with
  technology. Noting that it is a high-end gaming laptop company I felt these color combinations, communicated technology and
  sophistication.

* A shaded color palette for a website that sells natural and organic foods.

Filename: organic.png

Explanation of your color choices:
Green was a main color for my organic color palette. I chose earthy colors/tones such as green brown and beige.
Representing growth and earth, I felt these colors best conveyed organically grown foods.

* A complementary palette for a banking website.

Filename: financial.png
Explanation of your color choices:
For the banking site I chose to base colors that were a blue/green color. Blue representing trust and stability,
while green representing wealth and affluence. As the opposite or contrasting colors are a gold, and a taupe color.


* A triadic palette for a website that offers games for children.

Filename:
Explanation of your color choices:
For a site the was designed for children, using a triadic color scheme, I went with the primary colors. 
Primary colors or red, blue, and yellow, typically are used for relating to children and their learning.
